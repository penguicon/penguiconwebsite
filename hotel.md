* request a quiet floor or party floor,
* ask to be listed among the room parties,
* get your room's bed removed,
* or any other special requests.

In the meantime, please email roomparties@penguicon.org with room party questions, and hotel@penguicon.org with hotel questions.

## Hotel Amenities

Each of the guest rooms has a dual-line telephone with voice mail and data port, and a 32″ LCD TV.

The Westin is 100% non-smoking. They have a workout room, a pool, whirlpool, and have dog beds available. We would recommend only service animals be brought to the convention.

The Westin offers 15 PURE® Allergy Friendly Rooms designed specifically for guests with allergies or asthma. Surfaces are specially treated and air is continually circulated and purified, “drastically reducing irritants that could keep you from resting comfortably.”

The hotel has a limited number of refrigerators _(priority to those with medical needs)_, microwaves, and roll-away beds available. If you are interested in any of these items, please note that the refrigerators and microwaves are $10 each per night, and the roll-away bed is $30 per night. Roll-away beds will only be placed by the hotel in King rooms.

The hotel’s dining options are the Level 1 Lounge and Tango’s Restaurant.

Other meal options near the Westin include the Original Pancake House, CK Mediterranean Grille, Subway, Qdoba, China Gourmet, Chipotle, Kerby’s Koney Island, Benito’s, and T.G.I. Friday’s.
