Everyone involved with Penguicon is volunteering. There are no employees. But this page is for those who help with simple roles during the convention weekend, rather than taking on a big responsibility on Staff, ConCom, or Board, which we will discuss on other pages.

Penguicon’s success each year is due to our diverse community of volunteers that continue to give of their time and talents. There are many unique opportunities and volunteering for any amount of time is a wonderful way to give back to the community. We would love for you to join our team!Soon we will post our Volunteer Interest Form, job descriptions, the benefits you receive from volunteering, the dates of our Volunteer Bash event, and who is eligible to volunteer. Until then, please email volunteers@penguicon.org about your interest or questions.

## VOLUNTEER BASH

At Penguicon’s annual Volunteer Bash, you can sign up for your volunteer shifts, play games, eat food, win prizes, socialize with other volunteers, and have fun! This will take place in Spring of 2020, and we will announce it on all our communication channels.

## BENEFITS OF VOLUNTEERING

Besides that warm fuzzy feeling you get from helping out something that you love, although really that is pretty great, you can redeem the hours you work for rewards! Watch this space for announcements of what those rewards will be.
